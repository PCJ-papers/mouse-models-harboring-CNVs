This repository accompanies the paper *"Transcriptomic networks implicate neuronal energetics in three mouse models harboring psychosis-associated mutations"* by Aaron Gordon, Annika Gr√∏nborg-Forsingdal, Ib Vestergaard Klewe, Jacob Nielsen, Michael Didriksen, Thomas Werge, and Daniel Geschwind. 

The repository contains the compiled data used in the study as well as the sciprts used for differential expression and for constructing the WGNCA modules.
